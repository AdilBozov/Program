1. C is the oldest and most widely used language, providing the building blocks for other popular languages,
	such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. C is mostly used for implementing operating systems and 
	embedded applications. 

2. C++ is an intermediate-level language with object-oriented programming features, originally designed to
	enhance the C language. It's used to develop systems software, application software, high-performance
	server and client applications and video games.

3. Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used by the Apple operating system.
	It powers Apple's OS X and iOS, as well as its APIs, and can be used to create iPhone apps, which has
	generated a huge demand for this once-outmoded programming language.

4. Python is a high-level, server-side scripting language for websites and mobile apps. It's considered a fairly
	easy language for beginners due to its readability and compact syntax, meaning developers can use fewer
	lines of code to express a concept than they would in other languages.

5. JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of its
	syntax from C. It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing
	interactive or animated web functions. It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications.
